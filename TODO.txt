BUGS
- direct access to SpringcacheService breaks if springcache.disabled set in config
- check caching of service methods with defaulted params
- HEAD and GET requests seem to generate different keys

NEXT RELEASE
- make content negotiation awareness just a config param
- apply annotations to services at class level
- mime type key generator needs to only work if action uses withFormat (somehow)
- only cache GET requests?
- option to disable content caching filter

BACKLOG
- key generator per cache
- use annotations on taglibs
- cacheable version of g:render?
- configurable cacheable & cacheflush for controllers in plugins?
- expose caching statistics (JMX?)
- support reloading via onChange and onConfigChange
