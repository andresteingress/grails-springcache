		When a <code>&#64;Cacheable</code> annotation is found on a service method the plugin generates a key using:
<ul class="star">
<li>The <em class="italic">target</em> object, i.e. the service being called.</li>
<li>The service method name.</li>
<li>All method parameters.</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>Since Grails services are typically Spring singletons the target object is not usually an issue. There's no need to implements <em class="italic">equals</em> or <em class="italic">hashCode</em> on your service classes unless you are using a different Spring bean scope and need to differentiate between calls made to different instances of the service.<p class="paragraph"/>It is, however, <strong class="bold">vital</strong> to ensure that <em class="italic">equals</em> and <em class="italic">hashCode</em> is properly implemented on all the types used as parameters to cached methods. If this is not done it is very unlikely that the cache will ever be hit.
