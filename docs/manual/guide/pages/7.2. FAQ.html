    <h3>My cache config doesn't seem to be working.</h3><p class="paragraph"/>Ensure all your config for the <em class="italic">Springcache</em> plugin is nested inside a single <code>springcache</code> block in <code>Config.groovy</code> otherwise only the last block will take effect.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Can I programatically disable caching in specific circumstances such as when a user is logged in?</h3><p class="paragraph"/>Not right now, although I hope to add this to a future release of the plugin. I'd encourage you to think about structuring your pages using <em class="italic">SiteMesh</em> layouts and the <code>g:include</code> tag such that it is possible to separate the dynamic and cacheable sections.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Why isn't there a taglib so I can just wrap parts of my page that need caching?</h3><p class="paragraph"/>It's something I may add but from a purist point of view I'm not very keen on the idea. Caching is a separate concern from view rendering and the two really shouldn't be mixed up. So far the plugin has deliberately taken a declarative approach to caching which encourages you to maintain a good separation of concerns.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Can I use <code>&#64;Cacheable</code> on taglib Closures?</h3><p class="paragraph"/>Not yet. This is definitely on the roadmap for a future version of the plugin.
