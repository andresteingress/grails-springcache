 * "GRAILSPLUGINS-2553":http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILSPLUGINS-2553 Cached methods with default arguments are not intercepted unless all the arguments are specified. Therefore the cache is completely bypassed (neither hit or missed).
 * "GRAILSPLUGINS-2544":http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILSPLUGINS-2544 Due to a bug with Grails itself query string parameters are not included in the generated cache key. This can be a serious issue if you are using pagination for example as query string parameters such as @offset@ will be ignored resulting in the same cached content being served for every page. This *only* affects Grails version 1.3.4.
