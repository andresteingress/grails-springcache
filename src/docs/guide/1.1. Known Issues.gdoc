h3. Incompatibilities with specific Grails versions

h4. Grails 1.3.4

"GRAILSPLUGINS-2544":http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILSPLUGINS-2544 Due to a bug with Grails itself query string parameters are not included in the generated cache key. This can be a serious issue if you are using pagination for example as query string parameters such as @offset@ will be ignored resulting in the same cached content being served for every page.
