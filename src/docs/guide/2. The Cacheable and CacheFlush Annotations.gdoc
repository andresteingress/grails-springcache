The _Springcache_ plugin provides two annotations that are the basis of how you can apply caching and flushing behaviour to both Spring bean methods and page fragments. Both annotations are in the @grails.plugin.springcache.annotations@ package.

h3. The @\@Cachable@ annotation

The @Cacheable@ annotation is applied to methods on Spring managed beans such as Grails services to cache method results or to controller actions to cache page fragments. The annotation requires a cache name specified either as a standalone value or with the @cache@ element. The following declarations are equivalent:

{code}
\@Cacheable("myCache")
\@Cacheable(cache = "myCache")
{code}

To resolve the cache name in a non-standard way you can supply a @cacheResolver@ element, see [Cache Selection|guide:cacheSelection]. For content caching only you can also supply a @keyGenerator@ element, see [Content Cache Keys|guide:contentCacheKeys]

h3. The @\@CacheFlush@ annotation

The @CacheFlush@ annotation can be applied in the same places as the @Cacheable@ annotation but instead of caching results it will cause a cache or set of caches to be flushed. The @CacheFlush@ annotation requires a single element or a String array either as a standalone value or with the @caches@ element. Either way the elements can simply be literal cache names or regular expression patterns that may match multiple cache names. For example:

{code}
\@CacheFlush("myCache")
\@CacheFlush(/\w+ControllerCache/)
\@CacheFlush(["cacheA", "cacheB", "cacheC"])
\@CacheFlush(caches = ["cacheA", "cacheB", "cacheC"])
\@CacheFlush([/cache[A-Z]/, "myCache"])
{code}

To resolve the cache names in a non-standard way you can supply a @cacheResolver@ element, see [Cache Selection|guide:cacheSelection].
