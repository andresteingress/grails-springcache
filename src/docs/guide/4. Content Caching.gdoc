The @\@Cacheable@ and @\@CacheFlush@ annotations can be applied to controller actions and the plugin will then cache the page fragment generated by the controller whether this is done by rendering a GSP, using a _MarkupBuilder_ closure, rendering text directly or whatever. Only successful page renders are cached, so redirects, 404s, errors and so on will not be.

Composing pages so that they can be optimally cached requires some thought. The plugin uses a servlet filter that runs 'inside' the SiteMesh filter provided by Grails. This means that cached output is decorated by SiteMesh and the resulting page can therefore contain uncached content from the SiteMesh template. In addition you can use caching at a modular level to cache the output of controller actions invoked using the @g:include@ tag, or by caching taglib tags. Combining these techniques leads to powerful modular page caching. For example, you can cache the output of the 'main' controller then use @g:include@ tags, or taglib tags, in the SiteMesh layout to include content on the page that is cached separately - and can be flushed separately - from the main body of the page.
