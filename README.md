# Springcache Plugin

The _Springcache_ plugin allows you to easily add the following functionality to your Grails project:

 * Caching of Spring bean methods (typically Grails service methods).
 * Caching of page fragments generated by Grails controllers or taglibs.
 * Cache flushing when Spring bean methods or controller actions are invoked.

The plugin depends on the [EhCache][2] and [EhCache-Web][3] libraries.

Full documentation can be found [here][1].
